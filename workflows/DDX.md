# Document-Driven Development Experience (DDx)

DDx — Document-Driven Development Experience — is the tooling and
methodology layer that keeps governing documents current and uses them
to drive AI agents through software development.

The core insight: AI agents work best when they have structured, up-to-date
context. DDx provides that context through a maintained artifact graph and
the tools to keep it honest — so agents always know *what* to build, *why*,
and *how*, without human briefings or stale chat history.

## Core Principles

1. **Documents govern code.** Requirements, designs, and test plans are
   authoritative. Source code is evidence of implementation, not source of
   truth. When documents and code disagree, the document wins until
   explicitly amended.

2. **Authority flows downward.** Artifacts form a strict hierarchy. Higher
   artifacts govern lower ones absolutely. Conflicts resolve by deferring
   to the higher-authority artifact — never by silently overriding it.

3. **Specification before implementation.** Define the *what* and *why*
   before the *how*. Write acceptance criteria before tests. Write tests
   before code. Each layer constrains the next.

4. **Evolution is symmetric.** Adding a capability, removing a component,
   and amending a constraint all require the same top-down propagation
   through every affected artifact. The doc-first rule applies to removals
   and exclusions equally.

5. **Tests are executable specifications.** They encode design intent as
   assertions. Tests drive implementation but do not override the
   requirements or designs they encode — they are a bridge, not a source
   of authority.

6. **The artifact graph is the context.** An agent or developer entering
   a DDx project can build complete understanding from the artifacts alone.
   No tribal knowledge, no chat history, no implicit assumptions. The
   documents *are* the briefing.

## The Authority Hierarchy

DDx defines a strict precedence order for artifacts. When two artifacts
disagree, the one closer to the top governs:

| Level | Artifact Layer | Establishes |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Vision | Why the project exists, who it serves, what success looks like |
| 2 | Requirements | What to build, prioritized and scoped |
| 3 | Feature Specs / User Stories | Acceptance criteria per capability or behavior |
| 4 | Architecture / Decisions | System structure, binding constraints, rationale for choices |
| 5 | Solution & Technical Designs | Approach per feature or story |
| 6 | Test Plans / Executable Tests | Verification strategy and executable specs |
| 7 | Implementation Plans | Build sequencing and dependency order |
| 8 | Source Code / Build Artifacts | The running system |

Rules:

- Higher layers govern lower layers absolutely.
- Tests govern build execution but do not override requirements or design.
- Source code reflects current state but does not redefine the plan.
- If implementation conflicts with a governing artifact, fix the
  implementation — or explicitly amend the artifact first.

## Artifact Lifecycle

Every DDx artifact follows three states:

```
        create          validate         implement
 ────────►  DRAFT  ────────►  GOVERNING  ────────►  REALIZED
                         ▲                    │
                         │    evolve          │
                         └────────────────────┘
```

- **Draft** — Written but not yet validated against higher-authority
  artifacts. May contain inconsistencies.
- **Governing** — Consistent with the authority hierarchy and actively
  directing downstream work.
- **Realized** — Downstream artifacts and code fully satisfy this
  artifact's requirements. Tests pass. Acceptance criteria met.

State is inferred, not declared. A feature spec with no corresponding
design is framed but not designed. A design with passing tests is realized.
An alignment audit that flags drift sends a realized artifact back to
governing for evolution.

## The Evolution Model

Artifacts are living documents. When requirements change, the change must
propagate through the full artifact stack:

1. **Analyze** — Classify the change: addition, removal, amendment,
   new constraint, incident remediation.
2. **Discover** — Walk the artifact graph to identify every document in
   the blast radius.
3. **Detect conflicts** — Compare the proposed change against existing
   artifacts and in-flight work. Flag contradictions.
4. **Propagate top-down** — Amend artifacts from the highest-authority
   artifact down. A vision change flows to requirements, then specs, then designs,
   then test plans. Never update a lower artifact in a way that contradicts
   a higher one already amended.
5. **Decompose** — Derive implementation work items from the artifact
   changes. Each item should be independently verifiable.
6. **Wire dependencies** — Link new work to existing in-flight items.
   Mark supersessions where new work replaces obsolete items.
7. **Report** — Record what changed, what conflicted, and what needs
   human resolution.

This model ensures that a scope reduction (dropping a subsystem) receives
the same rigor as a scope expansion (adding a feature). Nothing is removed
by simply deleting code.

## Activities

DDx organizes work into activities that correspond to the authority hierarchy.
Each activity produces artifacts at its level before the next activity begins:

| Activity | Purpose | Artifacts Produced |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Discover** | Validate the opportunity | Vision, business case, competitive analysis |
| **Frame** | Define the problem | Requirements, feature specs, user stories, principles |
| **Design** | Architect the solution | Architecture, ADRs, solution designs, technical designs, contracts |
| **Test** | Specify verification | Test plans, test procedures, executable tests |
| **Build** | Implement the solution | Source code, work items, build artifacts |
| **Deploy** | Release and operate | Deployment checklists, monitoring setup, runbooks, release notes |
| **Iterate** | Learn and improve | Alignment reviews, retrospectives, metrics |

Activities are not strictly sequential — iteration sends realized artifacts
back through evolution, and early activities may be revisited when assumptions
prove wrong. But the authority hierarchy holds regardless of which
activity you are in: vision still governs code even during iteration.

## Agent Context Model

DDx solves the cold-start problem for AI agents. An agent entering a DDx
project does not need a briefing, a knowledge transfer, or chat history.
It reads the artifact graph.

**What the agent reads:**
- Project entry point (e.g., AGENTS.md) for structure and conventions
- Upstream artifacts (vision → requirements → specs) for *what* and *why*
- Design artifacts for *how*
- Test plans for verification strategy
- Work queue for *what to do next*

**How context stays current:**
- **Evolution** propagates requirement changes to all affected artifacts
- **Alignment audits** catch drift between artifacts and reality
- **Traceability** links every work item to its governing spec
- **Quality ratchets** prevent metric regression across iterations
- **Bounded actions** give agents clear entry/exit criteria per operation

**Why this works:**
- No implicit knowledge — everything is in versioned files
- Deterministic conflict resolution via the authority hierarchy
- Navigable traceability in both directions (spec → code, code → spec)
- Agents can enter at any point in the lifecycle and orient themselves

## DDx Tooling

DDx provides concrete tools for managing work items and design artifacts.
These are workflow-agnostic — any methodology can layer its own semantics
on top.

### Beads

Beads are portable, ephemeral work items with metadata. The name follows
the `bd` (Dolt-backed) and `br` (SQLite-backed) convention: short tool
names for the same conceptual unit. DDx beads use JSONL-backed local
storage; `bd` and `br` provide database-backed alternatives. All three
interchange via JSONL.

```
ddx bead create "Fix auth bug" --type bug --priority 1
ddx bead list --status open
ddx bead ready                    # Open beads with all deps satisfied
ddx bead dep add <id> <dep-id>    # Declare ordering constraints
ddx bead import --from bd         # Import from external bead stores
ddx bead export --stdout          # JSONL interchange
```

Beads carry between projects and tools. Unknown fields are preserved on
round-trip — this is how workflows like HELIX layer `spec-id`,
`execution-eligible`, and other workflow-specific metadata without DDx
needing to understand them.

Workflows register validation hooks (`.ddx/hooks/validate-bead-create`)
to enforce their own rules on top of DDx's base validation.

### Architecture Decision Records

```
ddx adr create "Use PostgreSQL for persistence"
ddx adr list [--status proposed]
ddx adr show ADR-001
ddx adr validate --all
```

ADRs capture binding decisions with context, rationale, alternatives, and
consequences. DDx scaffolds them with correct ID allocation, `ddx.id` /
`ddx.depends_on` frontmatter, and required section structure.

### Solution Designs

```
ddx sd create "User auth flow" --feature FEAT-002
ddx sd list
ddx sd show SD-001
ddx sd validate --all
```

Solution designs describe the chosen approach for a feature — scope,
acceptance criteria, solution approaches, and component changes.

### Workflow Capabilities

Beyond these core tools, a DDx-based workflow needs higher-level
capabilities that orchestrate them:

| Capability | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Frame** | Create upstream artifacts (vision, requirements, specs) |
| **Design** | Refine solution and technical designs |
| **Triage** | Decompose artifacts into beads |
| **Build** | Execute one bead against its governing artifacts |
| **Evolve** | Thread a requirement change through the artifact stack |
| **Align** | Audit artifact consistency and flag drift |
| **Review** | Post-implementation verification |
| **Check** | Route to the appropriate next action |

These capabilities are workflow-specific. HELIX provides all of them;
other workflows may implement a subset.

## HELIX

HELIX is a runtime-neutral methodology — an artifact catalog plus one routing
skill. DDx is one of three runtimes that adapt HELIX content (alongside Claude
Code and Databricks Code Genie). This section describes how the DDx runtime
realizes the HELIX workflow on top of DDx tools:

- **Activity labels** (`activity:build`, `activity:design`, etc.) on beads
- **Spec-id enforcement** linking every bead to its governing artifact
- **Execution-eligible** derivation from activity labels
- **Supervisory run loop** that sequences build/check/design/review
- **Agent orchestration** dispatching to Claude, Codex, virtual (recorded replay), or other agents
- **Quality ratchets** preventing metric regression

DDx provides the beads, ADRs, and SDs and the execution loop, tracker, and
dispatch that drive agents through them. HELIX provides the methodology and
artifact catalog those tools execute.

See [Workflow Contract](README.md) for the runtime-neutral operating model and
[CONTRACT-003](../docs/helix/02-design/contracts/CONTRACT-003-ddx-adapter-boundary.md)
for the DDx adapter boundary.
