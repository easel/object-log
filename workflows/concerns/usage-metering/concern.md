# Concern: Usage Metering (usage-based billing)

## Category

revenue-integrity

A metering pipeline that drives invoices is **financial-grade**: a miscount is
lost revenue (under-count) or an overcharge (over-count), so this is a
revenue-integrity concern, not an `observability` one. It deliberately does
**not** sit under `observability`: operational telemetry is best-effort, sampled,
and droppable; a meter that decides what a customer is billed must be **exact,
idempotent, reconcilable, and auditable**. Treating metering as "just another
metric" is the category error this concern exists to prevent.

## Areas

api, backend, data

## Boundary

This concern owns one thing: **every billable action emits an exact,
idempotent, auditable usage/meter event, and the metered total reconciles
against what is billed.** It cuts across the system the way `o11y-otel` does —
it instruments *every billable code path* — but with a financial-grade accuracy
bar that observability does not carry. It is **composable / non-exclusive**:
there is no slot, and it composes on top of whatever billing provider, event
transport, or persistence the product already uses.

Four neighbors must stay distinct:

- **`o11y-otel`** owns **operational** telemetry — traces, metrics, logs for
  debugging and incident response. That telemetry is best-effort and **sampled**:
  dropping or approximating a span is acceptable. A **usage/meter event is the
  opposite** — it is financial, exact, idempotent, and auditable; a dropped or
  double-counted meter event is a revenue defect, not a missing data point. Do
  **not** conflate metering with logging/metrics: a `log.info("charged user")`
  or a Prometheus counter is **not** a meter event. Emit RED metrics *and* a
  meter event on a billable path; they are different obligations with different
  accuracy bars.
- **`event-sourcing`** owns the event-stream persistence mechanic. Usage events
  **can** be persisted as an append-only event stream (an immutable usage
  ledger is exactly the recommended store), but event-sourcing is **one
  implementation** of the audit/replay requirement, not a prerequisite —
  **compose** with it where present; do not require it. This concern states
  *that* metered usage must be reconstructible and replayable; ES is one way to
  hold it.
- **`enterprise-integration-patterns`** owns the messaging/integration mechanics
  at the edge. **Emitting meter events to the billing system** (Stripe meter
  events, usage records) is an integration edge: the **idempotent-receiver**
  pattern applies so the billing system de-dupes a retried emission, and the
  outbound emission is an at-least-once delivery that must not double-charge.
  EIP owns the **transport**; this concern owns *what* must be exact across it.
- **`domain-driven-design`** owns the domain model. A usage event is a
  **domain/integration event with billing meaning** (`ApiCallMetered`,
  `SeatProvisioned`) — DDD names it and gives it ubiquitous language; this
  concern adds the financial-grade capture/idempotency/reconciliation rules that
  a billing event carries beyond an ordinary domain event.

## Components

- **Capture** — at the point of the billable action, on its **real code path**,
  emit a usage/meter event carrying: the metered subject (customer/tenant), the
  quantity (value), the event name/meter, a timestamp, and a **dedupe key**.
  Capture happens where the action actually completes, not in a helper that
  nothing calls.
- **Idempotency key** — every event carries a stable unique identifier (a
  deterministic key derived from the action, or a UUID persisted with it) so
  that retries and at-least-once delivery **de-duplicate** instead of
  double-counting. Stripe enforces uniqueness of the meter event `identifier`
  over a rolling ≥24h window; OpenMeter de-dupes by CloudEvents `id` + `source`.
- **Aggregation** — usage is rolled up over a billing period by a defined
  function: **SUM** (most consumption billing), **COUNT** (equal-weight events),
  **MAX** (peak, e.g. parallel jobs / seats), **UNIQUE_COUNT** (distinct
  entities), **LAST** (snapshot/state). MIN/MAX are duplicate-tolerant; SUM/COUNT
  are **not** and depend on capture-time dedupe being correct.
- **Rating / pricing** — applying the price to the aggregate: tiers, volume
  pricing, **included quotas**, and **overage**. Rating is deterministic and
  reconstructible from the same aggregated input.
- **Emission to billing** — pushing the metered/rated usage to the billing
  system (Stripe meter events / usage records, or an OSS meter like Lago /
  OpenMeter). Emission is **idempotent** (carries the dedupe key end-to-end) and
  prefers **delta writes** so a re-emit does not re-bill.
- **Reconciliation / audit** — an **independent count** (the raw event ledger,
  or the billing system's reported total) is compared against the metered total
  on a schedule; a divergence beyond a small tolerance is flagged. The meter is
  **auditable**: each billed quantity traces back to the events that produced it.

## Constraints

### Metering is financial-grade, not best-effort

- A usage/meter event that drives billing must be **exact, idempotent, and
  auditable**. An under-count silently loses revenue; an over-count overcharges
  the customer. Neither is acceptable as "eventually close enough", which is the
  bar `o11y-otel` telemetry is held to and this concern is **not**.
- A meter event is **not** a log line or an operational metric. Emitting a log
  or incrementing a Prometheus counter on a billable path does **not** satisfy
  this concern; a distinct meter event with a dedupe key must be emitted.

### Every billable action meters on its real code path

- A metering function that **exists but is never invoked on the request/job
  path** is a defect — the usage is silently un-metered (revenue leak). The wire
  is the deliverable, not the function. Verify the **call site on the live path**,
  not just the definition.
- Metering is wired at the point the billable action actually completes, so a
  path that does the work but skips the emit is caught.

### Idempotency: replay must not double-count

- Every event carries a **dedupe/idempotency key**, and a retried or
  re-delivered identical action **meters exactly once**. At-least-once delivery
  is assumed; double-counting on retry is a defect.
- Dedupe is enforced where it can be (capture-time ledger uniqueness, and the
  billing system's `identifier` window), not assumed away.

### Reconciliation: the meter is auditable

- The metered total is periodically reconciled against an **independent count**
  (raw event ledger and/or the billing system's reported usage); a divergence
  beyond a recorded tolerance is surfaced, not ignored. "Invoice parity" — the
  metered total matches what the billing system will bill **before** the invoice
  closes — is the target.
- Every billed quantity is traceable to the source events that produced it; the
  raw usage record is retained for audit/dispute.

### Late, out-of-order, and corrected usage are handled deliberately

- Late-arriving and out-of-order events are handled by a defined policy
  (re-aggregation within a lateness window; an explicit adjustment beyond it),
  not by silently dropping or mis-attributing them to the wrong period.
- Backfill/correction is an explicit, recorded operation (a compensating
  adjustment), never an in-place mutation that breaks the audit trail.

## Drift Signals (anti-patterns to reject in review)

- A `recordUsage` / `meter()` / `trackUsage` function **defined but not called**
  on the real request/job path → un-metered billable action; wire it at the
  call site and verify on the running system
- A billable action with **no meter event** emitted (work done, usage never
  captured) → revenue leak; add capture on the real path
- A meter event with **no dedupe/idempotency key**, or a key that is not stable
  across retries → double-count risk; carry a stable identifier end-to-end
- A retried/duplicate action that **meters twice** → idempotency defect; enforce
  dedupe at capture and at emission
- A `log.info(...)` / metrics counter used **as** the billing source of truth →
  operational telemetry standing in for a meter; emit a real meter event
- **No reconciliation** between metered total and an independent count, or a
  flagged divergence left un-triaged → the meter is unauditable; add the
  reconciliation loop and a tolerance alarm
- Late/out-of-order events **silently dropped** or attributed to the wrong
  period → handle within a defined lateness window or as an explicit adjustment
- Backfill/correction done as an **in-place mutation** of past usage → use a
  recorded compensating adjustment that preserves the audit trail
- A SUM/COUNT aggregation built on a capture path with **no dedupe** → the
  aggregate is unsound; fix dedupe before trusting the total

## When to use

Any product with **usage-based / consumption / metered / seat-overage billing**
— where what a customer owes depends on **how much they used** (API calls,
tokens, compute-seconds, events processed, storage, active seats with overage).
It is composable (no slot); `areas: api, backend, data` scope its practices to
the billable code paths and the usage data layer. Compose with the billing/
integration edge (`enterprise-integration-patterns` for idempotent emission),
with `domain-driven-design` (which names the usage event), optionally with
`event-sourcing` (one way to hold the usage ledger), and with `verification`
(whose evidence gate proves the metering is **wired and exercised on the running
system**, not merely defined). Do **not** select it for **flat-fee /
seat-only-with-no-overage** subscriptions, free products, or non-commercial /
internal tools where no usage drives a charge.

## Artifact Impact

Selecting this concern requires these artifacts to change (a selected concern absent from them is drift):
- ADR: metering + billing model (aggregation function, idempotency, emission, reconciliation)
- TD: capture on real path / idempotency key / aggregation / rating / emit / reconcile
- FEAT: which actions are billable and the meter each emits
- DATA_DESIGN: usage/meter event ledger with dedupe key, retained for audit
- TEST_PLAN: retried action meters once (idempotency) + metered-total reconciliation
