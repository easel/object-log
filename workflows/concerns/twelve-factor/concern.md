# Concern: Twelve-Factor App

## Category

infrastructure

This is **infra**, not architecture. It does not decide internal layering,
dependency direction, or how many deployables the system ships as — it governs
the **per-process operational contract** every deployed process honors so it
can be built, configured, scaled, and disposed of by a cloud platform without
code changes. The decisions it forces (config from the environment, state
externalized, logs to stdout, graceful shutdown) live in the ADR, the
deployment checklist/runbook, and the process-model section of the technical
design — the operational-hygiene layer, not the application-design layer.

## Areas

## Boundary

This concern is the **per-process operational contract** a deployed process
honors so a platform can manage it. It is non-exclusive (no slot) and composes
with three neighbors that must stay distinct:

- **`deployment-topology`** decides **how many deployables the system ships as
  and along which seams they split** (modular monolith vs microservices vs
  serverless). Twelve-factor is **downstream and orthogonal**: it is the
  operational contract **each** of those deployables honors regardless of how
  many there are. One modular monolith and a fleet of microservices both run as
  twelve-factor processes; topology decides the count, twelve-factor decides
  what each process must be. This concern does **not** restate the
  forcing-function / fault-line / distributed-monolith rules.
- **`o11y-otel`** decides **what telemetry to emit and how it is
  structured** — traces, RED metrics, structured-JSON log schema, trace
  context. Twelve-factor decides only the **logs-as-event-streams transport
  rule**: the process writes its event stream to **stdout, unbuffered**, and
  never manages log files, routing, or rotation itself; the execution
  environment captures and routes the stream. The two **compose**: o11y says
  *what each log line contains*, twelve-factor says *where the process puts it*.
  This concern does **not** specify log schema, span naming, or metric names.
- **`k8s-kind`** (and any `deploy-target` filler) is the **runtime that
  consumes a twelve-factor process** — the cluster, Helm charts, image builds,
  the env-var/secret injection, the SIGTERM lifecycle, the port it binds. The
  twelve-factor process is the *thing being deployed*; the deploy-target is the
  *platform deploying it*. A process that honors this contract (config from env,
  port binding, graceful shutdown, stateless, scale-by-process) is the input a
  platform expects; this concern does **not** specify cluster/Helm/image-build
  mechanics. They are designed to fit together.

## Components

The twelve factors, grouped by what each protects:

### Build-time hygiene (codebase, dependencies, build/release/run)

- **Codebase** — one codebase tracked in revision control, **many deploys**.
  One repo per app; multiple apps sharing code do so via declared dependencies,
  not a shared codebase. The same codebase produces every deploy (dev,
  staging, prod), which differ only by config.
- **Dependencies** — dependencies are **explicitly declared** (a manifest) and
  **isolated** (a dependency-isolation tool), so the app never relies on
  system-wide packages leaking in. No implicit reliance on tools existing on
  the host.
- **Build, release, run** — **strictly separate** the three stages. *Build*
  turns code into an executable bundle; *release* combines a build with that
  deploy's config into an immutable, uniquely-versioned artifact; *run* executes
  the release. Releases are immutable and **cannot be mutated at runtime** —
  any change is a new release. Code cannot be changed at run time (no editing
  on the running box).

### Config + resources (config, backing services)

- **Config** — everything that **varies between deploys** lives in the
  **environment** (env vars), not in code or checked-in per-environment config
  files. Credentials, resource handles, and per-deploy hostnames are env vars,
  each orthogonal and independently managed. **Litmus test:** the codebase could
  be made open source at any moment without leaking a single credential. Reject
  grouped `config/production.rb`-style "environments" (combinatorial explosion);
  env vars are granular and per-deploy.
- **Backing services** — every service consumed over the network (database,
  cache, queue, SMTP, object store, third-party API) is an **attached
  resource** referenced only by a config-supplied handle. Local Postgres and
  Amazon RDS are the same kind of resource to the code; swapping one for the
  other is a **config change, not a code change**. No code distinguishes a
  local resource from a third-party one.

### Process model (processes, port binding, concurrency)

- **Processes** — the app executes as **one or more stateless,
  share-nothing processes**. Any data that must persist goes to a stateful
  backing service. **No sticky state** held in process memory or local disk
  across requests — no in-memory session store assumed to survive, no reliance
  on a request hitting the same process (no sticky sessions).
- **Port binding** — the app is **completely self-contained** and exports its
  service by **binding to a port** itself (it ships its own HTTP server), rather
  than being injected into a runtime webserver container. The port is supplied
  by the environment; one app's exported service can be another's backing
  service.
- **Concurrency** — scale **out via the process model**: handle diverse
  workloads with multiple process *types* (web, worker, clock) and scale each
  type **horizontally** by running more processes. Processes do not daemonize or
  write PID files; rely on the platform's process manager.

### Lifecycle + parity (disposability, dev/prod parity, logs, admin processes)

- **Disposability** — processes are **disposable**: **fast startup** (a few
  seconds to ready) so scaling and deploys are nimble, and **graceful shutdown
  on SIGTERM** — stop accepting new work, drain in-flight work, exit. Workers
  return unfinished jobs to the queue (NACK / auto-requeue) and **all jobs are
  reentrant/idempotent**, so the app is also **robust against sudden death**
  (crash-only): an unexpected kill leaves no corruption.
- **Dev/prod parity** — keep dev, staging, and prod **as similar as
  possible**, closing the **time gap** (deploy in hours, not weeks), the
  **personnel gap** (authors operate what they ship), and the **tools gap** —
  most importantly, use the **same type and version of each backing service**
  across all environments (no SQLite-in-dev / Postgres-in-prod substitution).
- **Logs** — treat logs as **event streams**: the process writes its
  unbuffered event stream to **stdout** and never concerns itself with routing,
  storage, or rotation. The execution environment captures and routes the
  stream. (Structure and content of those events are `o11y-otel`'s concern.)
- **Admin processes** — run admin/management tasks (migrations, one-off
  scripts, REPL/console) as **one-off processes against an identical release**:
  same codebase, same config, same dependency isolation as the long-running
  processes — not as ad-hoc commands on a hand-configured box.

## Constraints

### Config and secrets live in the environment, never in the codebase

- Everything that varies between deploys is supplied by the **environment**
  (env vars or an injected env). **No credential, hostname, port, or
  per-deploy literal is committed** to the repo — the open-source litmus test
  must hold. Grouped checked-in per-environment config files (a
  `production`/`staging` config set in the repo) are rejected in favor of
  granular per-deploy env vars.

### Backing services are swappable by config alone

- Every networked dependency is an **attached resource** addressed only through
  a config-supplied handle. Code MUST NOT branch on whether a resource is local
  or third-party. Swapping a backing service (local DB → managed DB, local SMTP
  → email API) MUST be possible with a **config change and zero code change**.

### Processes are stateless and share-nothing

- No state needed across requests is held in process memory or on local disk.
  Persistent state goes to a backing service. The app MUST NOT assume sticky
  sessions, an in-process cache that survives a restart, or that a follow-up
  request reaches the same process. Scaling is horizontal across share-nothing
  processes.

### Build, release, run are separated and releases are immutable

- The artifact that runs is an **immutable, versioned release** (a build + that
  deploy's config). It MUST NOT be mutated at run time; any change is a new
  release with a new version. No editing code or config on a running instance.

### Disposable: fast startup, graceful SIGTERM shutdown, crash-safe

- Processes start in seconds and shut down gracefully on **SIGTERM** (refuse new
  work, drain in-flight, exit). Worker jobs are **reentrant/idempotent** and
  returned to the queue on interruption, so a sudden kill never corrupts state.

### Logs stream to stdout; the process does not manage log files

- The process writes its event stream to **stdout, unbuffered**, and does
  **not** open, route, or rotate log files itself. Log routing/retention is the
  environment's job. (What each line contains is `o11y-otel`.)

### Dev/prod parity — same backing services across environments

- Dev, staging, and prod use the **same type and version of each backing
  service**. A lightweight local substitute that differs from production (e.g.
  SQLite locally, Postgres in prod) is a parity gap to reject.

### Admin tasks run as one-off processes on an identical release

- Migrations and one-off scripts run in the **same release** (code + config +
  dependency isolation) as the app's long-running processes — not as commands
  hand-run against a bespoke environment.

## Drift Signals (anti-patterns to reject in review)

- A credential, hostname, port, or per-deploy value **committed to the repo**
  (or a checked-in `config/production.*`) → fails the open-source litmus test;
  move it to the environment
- Code that **branches on local-vs-third-party** for a backing service, or a
  service that cannot be swapped without a code change → make it an attached
  resource addressed by a config handle
- **Sticky state in process memory / local disk** assumed across requests
  (in-process session store, sticky sessions, a cache that must survive a
  restart) → externalize to a backing service; make processes share-nothing
- A **mutated running instance** (code/config edited in place) or a release
  that is not immutable + versioned → rebuild a new release; never mutate at run
  time
- **No SIGTERM handling** (process killed mid-request, jobs lost on shutdown),
  slow startup, or **non-idempotent jobs** that corrupt on re-run → add graceful
  drain + reentrant jobs
- The app **writing/rotating its own log files** instead of streaming to stdout
  → emit the unbuffered event stream to stdout; let the environment route it
- A **different backing service in dev than prod** (SQLite vs Postgres, an
  in-memory queue vs the real broker) → align type and version across
  environments
- A migration / admin task run as an **ad-hoc command on a hand-configured box**
  rather than a one-off process on an identical release → run it in the release
- Twelve-factor rules conflated with the **topology** (`deployment-topology` —
  how many deployables) or the **runtime** (`k8s-kind` — the platform) → keep
  them separate; this concern is the per-process contract

## When to use

Select for **any deployed long-running service or app** — anything that runs as
a process a platform manages and that has config and/or backing services. The
contract is what lets that process be deployed, configured, scaled, and disposed
of without code changes.

**Skip** for artifacts with no per-process operational contract to honor:
**libraries** (consumed in-process, no deploy/config/backing-services surface),
**static / marketing sites** (no running process, no config in the environment),
and **CLIs with no config or backing services** (a one-shot tool with nothing to
externalize). A CLI or tool that *does* read config and talk to backing services
is a deployed-process-like surface and may select it.

It **composes** (no slot) with `deployment-topology` (which decides how many
deployables each honor this contract), `o11y-otel` (which structures the events
this concern streams to stdout), and `k8s-kind` / the `deploy-target` filler
(the runtime that consumes the twelve-factor process). `areas: infra` scopes its
practices to the infrastructure / process-contract work items.

## Artifact Impact

Selecting this concern requires these artifacts to change (a selected concern absent from them is drift):
- ADR: config + state + backing-services strategy (env-sourced config, attached resources, stateless processes), build/release/run + disposability
- TD: process model (stateless share-nothing, port binding, concurrency), logs to stdout, graceful SIGTERM, admin-as-one-off
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN: deployment checklist/runbook — env-var config, dev/prod parity, immutable releases, migrations as one-off processes

## ADR References

Selecting this concern **forces ADR content**: the ADR MUST record the
**config + state + backing-services strategy** — where config and secrets come
from (the environment / injected env, never the repo), which datastore/cache/
queue/external services are **attached resources** addressed by config handles
and therefore swappable, and the **state strategy** that keeps processes
stateless (where persistent and session state live). It MUST also note the
**build/release/run** discipline (immutable versioned releases) and the
**disposability** contract (graceful SIGTERM, reentrant jobs). A material
uncertainty (an unproven backing-service choice, an undecided secrets source) is
a `tech-spike`, not a silent gap (see
`workflows/references/concern-resolution.md`).
