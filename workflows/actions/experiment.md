# HELIX Action: Experiment

You are performing one bounded experiment iteration within a metric-optimization
session tracked via the runtime-provided work-item source.

Your goal is to hypothesize a change, implement it within scoped files, verify
correctness, benchmark the result, make a keep/discard decision, log everything,
and exit. The external loop (the experiment skill or the operator re-invoking
this action) decides whether to continue iterating.

This action performs one experiment iteration. It modifies only files declared in
scope, does not change test expectations, and does not implement new features.
Session state (`autoresearch.*`, `experiments/`) is ephemeral and gitignored on
the experiment branch. The experiment is execution-layer work tracked by an issue;
the result is recorded in the issue close comment, not as a canonical HELIX doc.
The only normative artifact the experiment may create or update is a metric
definition at `docs/helix/06-iterate/metrics/`.

## Regression Bench (validating a methodology or skill change)

When the change under test is a **methodology or skill change** (a workflow
prompt, an artifact template, the routing skill) rather than product code, run
it as a **regression bench**. The bench is the same `activity:iterate`
machinery — metric definition, keep/discard rule, confidence scoring — applied
to the question "does this change actually matter?" cheaply and without
self-confirmation bias:

1. **Record a baseline.** Fix a representative brief and run it against a
   committed baseline of the methodology — the **bare prompt**, no improved
   content. Record the intrinsic metrics it produces in a metric definition
   (`baseline`/`target` fields; see the metric-definition template). Commit the
   baseline so re-runs compare against a fixed point, not a moving memory.
2. **Make the change.** Land the methodology/skill change under test.
3. **Install the improved skill, then re-run from the bare prompt.** Re-run the
   *same brief* with the improved skill **installed** — not by redirecting the
   agent to read the changed files. Reading-by-redirection confounds the
   result: it measures "agent told to use the new thing" instead of "the new
   thing is in force." The bare prompt against the installed skill is the only
   honest comparison.
4. **Score intrinsic metrics against the baseline.** Use intrinsic,
   mechanically checkable metrics (build/test pass, template conformance,
   phantom-claim count, concern auto-selection, real-vs-stub output) — the same
   metric-definition contract as any other experiment. Compare to the recorded
   baseline.
5. **Keep what moved; cut what didn't.** A change that does not move a metric
   relative to baseline is **cut**, not kept on faith. "It feels better" is not
   evidence; the bench is how a methodology change earns its place.

The regression bench is the durable asset: it separates real wins from noise
and is the standing answer to "how do we know this change is impactful." Fix
the instrument before trusting its reading — a metric that disagrees with the
template it scores (template↔meta drift) is a broken instrument, not a bad run
(see the metric-definition `command_verified` check and FEAT-016).

## Action Input

You may receive:

- no argument (auto-select a ready `activity:iterate` work item)
- an explicit work item ID
- a goal description such as `optimize test-suite-runtime`
- a `--close` flag directing you to skip iteration and execute Step 3

## Authority Hierarchy

When artifacts disagree, use this hierarchy:

1. Product Vision
2. Product Requirements
3. Feature Specs / User Stories
4. Architecture / ADRs
5. Solution Designs / Technical Designs
6. Test Plans / Tests
7. Implementation Plans
8. Source Code / Build Artifacts

Rules:

- Higher layers govern lower layers.
- Tests govern build execution but do not override requirements or design.
- Source code reflects current state but does not redefine the plan.
- If an issue conflicts with its governing artifacts, do not implement the drift.
- Prefer aligning code and docs to plan. Only propose plan changes when the
  evidence is strong and the governing artifacts are stale or incomplete.

## Tracker Rules

Use the runtime-provided work-item source only.

This action works only on execution work items labeled `activity:iterate`. Exclude
review items and build/deploy items by default.

The experiment action claims one item at session setup, may create follow-on
items during execution, and closes the item at session close.

## STEP 0 - Bootstrap

0. **Context Recovery**: Re-read AGENTS.md so project instructions are fresh
   in your working memory. After long sessions, context compaction may have
   dropped critical project rules. This step is cheap insurance against drift.
0a. **Load active design principles** following the principles-resolution
   reference for this runtime. Use them to inform metric selection and
   experiment design decisions.
0b. **Load active concerns and practices** following the concern-resolution
   reference for this runtime. Experiments must use the declared concerns —
   do not introduce alternative tools or frameworks as part of an optimization
   experiment.
1. Verify the runtime-provided work-item source is available. Stop immediately if unavailable.
2. Load ratchet floor fixtures if the project has adopted quality ratchets.
   Note the current floors so Step 3 can compare against them for auto-bump
   decisions.
3. Determine the invocation mode:
   - If `--close` directive: skip directly to Step 3.
   - If resuming (session files exist — `autoresearch.md` is present in the
     worktree): read `autoresearch.md`, `autoresearch.jsonl`, and
     `experiments/worklog.md` to recover session state. Skip to Step 2.
   - If fresh start (no session files, no `--close`): proceed to Step 1.

Resume detection is file-based, not flag-based. The presence of
`autoresearch.md` in the worktree root is the authoritative signal that a
session is in progress. This survives context compaction and agent restarts.

## STEP 1 - Session Setup

This activity runs on the first invocation only. If resuming, Step 0 skips here.

### 1.1 Issue Selection

Select the experiment work item:

1. If the input is an explicit work item ID: inspect that item.
2. If the input is a goal description: search ready `activity:iterate` items
   matching the goal.
3. If no input is given: inspect ready `activity:iterate` execution items and
   choose the best candidate.

The selected item MUST:

- be labeled `activity:iterate`
- have passing tests (the project's test suite must be green before
  experimenting)
- have clear acceptance criteria defining what metric to optimize
- not be a review item or a build/deploy item

If no eligible item exists, report the reason and exit cleanly.

### 1.2 Claim Work Item

Claim the selected item via the runtime-provided work-item source.

### 1.3 Authority Check

Load the governing artifacts referenced by the issue:

- `spec-id`
- parent epic or parent issue
- dependency tree
- linked user story, feature, design, or test artifacts

Verify the optimization goal is consistent with architecture and design docs.
If the issue's goal contradicts a higher-authority artifact, do not proceed.
Document the conflict and exit.

### 1.4 Metric Definition

Load or create the primary metric definition:

- If a metric definition exists at `docs/helix/06-iterate/metrics/<name>.yaml`,
  read `name`, `unit`, `direction`, `command`, and `tolerance` from it.
- If no metric definition exists, create one during setup using the
  metric-definition template from the runtime's templates directory. Commit
  the new metric definition to the canonical location
  (`docs/helix/06-iterate/metrics/<name>.yaml`) before branching. This is a
  normative artifact at authority level 5-6.

Record:

- **Primary metric**: name, unit, direction, measurement command
- **Secondary metrics** (optional): additional metrics to capture for
  monitoring/analysis but NOT used for keep/discard decisions
- **Files in scope**: every file the agent may modify during this experiment
- **Off-limits files**: files and directories that must NOT be modified
- **Constraints**: additional rules (no new dependencies, no API changes, etc.)

### 1.5 Correctness Check Definition

Define the correctness check command in `autoresearch.md` under a "Correctness
Check" section. Use the project's standard test command (e.g., `npm test`,
`cargo test`, `pytest`) from AGENTS.md or CI configuration. If the project
defines `autoresearch.checks.sh`, use that instead.

The correctness check is mandatory. Tests MUST pass after every iteration. If
tests fail, the experiment is discarded regardless of metric improvement. This
is non-negotiable — tests must pass at every step.

### 1.6 Branch and Session Files

1. Create the experiment branch:
   `git checkout -b experiment/<goal>-<date>`

2. Add session file patterns to `.gitignore` on the experiment branch and
   commit:
   ```
   # Experiment session files (ephemeral, local-only)
   autoresearch.md
   autoresearch.sh
   autoresearch.jsonl
   experiments/
   ```

3. Create ephemeral session files (untracked, local-only):
   - `autoresearch.md` — session doc, populated from the autoresearch-session
     template. References the metric definition by path. Contains objective,
     metrics, correctness check, files in scope, off-limits, constraints, and
     "What's Been Tried" section.
   - `autoresearch.sh` — benchmark script, derived from the metric definition's
     `command` field. Must output `METRIC <name>=<value>` lines to stdout.
     Make it executable (`chmod +x autoresearch.sh`).
   - `experiments/worklog.md` — narrative log, populated from the
     autoresearch-worklog template.
   - `autoresearch.jsonl` — initialize with a config header line:
     ```json
     {"type":"config","goal":"<goal>","metric":"<name>","direction":"<lower|higher>","issue":"<id>","started":"<ISO-8601>"}
     ```

4. Session files are never committed. They are local working state for the
   active agent session. They survive context compaction but not `git clone`
   or branch push/pull.

### 1.7 Baseline Measurement

Run the benchmark script (`./autoresearch.sh`) to establish the baseline.

Log the baseline as run #1:

- Append to `autoresearch.jsonl`:
  ```json
  {"type":"result","run":1,"status":"baseline","metric":"<name>","value":<N>,"commit":"<hash>","timestamp":"<ISO-8601>","description":"Baseline measurement"}
  ```
- Write the baseline entry to `experiments/worklog.md`.

The baseline is the reference point for all future keep/discard decisions and
delta calculations.

## STEP 2 - Single Experiment Iteration

This is the core loop body. Each invocation executes exactly one iteration.

### Step 1: Hypothesize

Based on:

- profiling data (if available)
- prior results from `autoresearch.jsonl`
- worklog insights from `experiments/worklog.md`
- the "What's Been Tried" section of `autoresearch.md`

Form a specific, testable hypothesis about what change will improve the primary
metric. Record the hypothesis before making changes.

### Step 2: Edit

Modify only files declared in the "Files in Scope" section of
`autoresearch.md`. Do not touch off-limits files. Do not change test
expectations. Do not add new features.

### Step 3: Correctness Check (FIRST)

Run the project test suite (the command defined in `autoresearch.md` under
"Correctness Check").

- If tests FAIL: skip benchmarking entirely. Proceed directly to Step 5
  with a discard decision. Do not waste time benchmarking broken code.
- If tests PASS: proceed to Step 4.

### Step 4: Benchmark

Run `./autoresearch.sh` to measure the primary metric.

Capture:

- Primary metric value
- Secondary metric values (if defined)
- Wall-clock time of the benchmark run

This step is only reached if the correctness check passed.

### Step 5: Keep or Discard

Apply the decision rules:

**Keep** (metric improved AND tests passed):
- `git add <scoped files only>`
- `git commit -m "experiment: <brief description of change>"`
- Record the commit hash for logging.

**Discard** (metric worse, metric equal, OR tests failed):
- `git checkout -- <file1> <file2> ...` (scoped revert only — list the
  specific files from "Files in Scope", never `git checkout -- .`)
- Do not delete untracked files created by the experiment; only revert
  tracked scoped files.

**Simplicity preference**:
- A change that removes code or reduces complexity for equal or better
  performance is always a keep.
- A change that adds significant complexity for marginal improvement (below
  the confidence threshold) should be discarded.
- When two approaches yield similar metric values, prefer the simpler one.

### Step 6: Log to JSONL

Append the iteration result to `autoresearch.jsonl`:

```json
{"type":"result","run":<N>,"status":"<kept|discarded>","metric":"<name>","value":<N>,"delta_vs_baseline":"<+/-N%>","delta_vs_best":"<+/-N%>","commit":"<hash-or-null>","timestamp":"<ISO-8601>","description":"<hypothesis and what changed>","tests_passed":<true|false>}
```

Fields:

- `run`: sequential iteration number (read from JSONL to determine next)
- `status`: `kept` or `discarded`
- `metric`: primary metric name
- `value`: measured value (null if tests failed before benchmarking)
- `delta_vs_baseline`: percentage change from run #1
- `delta_vs_best`: percentage change from best kept result so far
- `commit`: git commit hash if kept, null if discarded
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp
- `description`: the hypothesis and what was changed
- `tests_passed`: boolean

### Step 7: Worklog Entry

Append a narrative entry to `experiments/worklog.md` following the template
format:

```markdown
### Run N: <description> -- <metric>=<value> (<KEPT or DISCARDED>)

- Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- What changed: <one to two sentences>
- Result: <metric>=<value> (<delta vs best>)
- Insight: <what was learned>
- Next: <what to try based on this>
```

### Step 8: Confidence Scoring

Read the full `autoresearch.jsonl` history. If 3 or more results exist
(excluding the baseline), compute a confidence score:

```
confidence = |best_improvement| / MAD
```

Where:
- `best_improvement` = best metric value minus baseline value (sign-adjusted
  for direction)
- `MAD` = median absolute deviation of all measured values from their median

Interpretation:

- `>= 2.0` — likely genuine improvement (signal well above noise)
- `1.0 - 2.0` — marginal, above noise but not strongly significant
- `< 1.0` — within noise floor, improvement may be measurement variance

If fewer than 3 results exist, report `EXPERIMENT_CONFIDENCE: insufficient_data`
in the trailer.

### Step 9: Update Session Doc

Read `autoresearch.jsonl` to determine the total iteration count. If the
iteration count is a multiple of 5, update the "What's Been Tried" section in
`autoresearch.md` with:

- Summary of the last 5 experiments
- Key patterns observed across all experiments
- Which approaches worked, which did not, and why

This keeps the session doc useful for hypothesis formation in future iterations,
especially after context compaction.

## STEP 3 - Session Close

This activity is invoked explicitly via a `--close` flag or by the skill when
iteration is complete. It does NOT run during normal iteration.

### 3.1 Authority Check

Review the cumulative diff on the experiment branch against governing
artifacts. Verify that the total set of changes is consistent with the issue's
scope and the project's architecture. If the cumulative diff has drifted from
the issue's intent, flag the problem and determine whether to proceed.

### 3.2 Zero-Improvement Case

Read `autoresearch.jsonl` to determine whether any iterations were kept.

If no iterations were kept (best equals baseline):

- Skip the squash-merge — there are no code changes to merge.
- Close the issue with a note recording what was tried, how many iterations
  ran, and why nothing improved. This is a valid outcome. Not every
  experiment produces improvement.
- Proceed to cleanup (3.5).

### 3.3 Ratchet Floor Update

If the project has performance ratchets (loaded in Step 0) and the best
result exceeds the current ratchet floor + auto-bump threshold:

- Update the ratchet floor fixture file with the new floor value.
- The floor update will be included in the squash commit.

If the best result does not exceed the auto-bump threshold, do not update the
floor. The improvement is real but not large enough to raise the committed
floor.

### 3.4 Squash-Merge

If iterations were kept:

1. Identify the original branch (the branch the experiment branch was created
   from).
2. Switch to the original branch:
   `git checkout <original-branch>`
3. Squash-merge the experiment branch:
   `git merge --squash experiment/<goal>-<date>`
4. Create the squash commit with a comprehensive message:
   ```
   experiment(<goal>): <one-line summary of result>

   Issue: <issue-id>
   Metric: <name> (<unit>, <direction> is better)
   Baseline: <baseline-value>
   Final: <best-value> (<delta>% improvement)
   Iterations: <total> run, <kept> kept
   Confidence: <score>

   Key changes:
   - <summary of kept changes>

   Ratchet floor updated: <yes/no, old -> new if yes>
   ```
5. If a ratchet floor update applies, ensure the updated floor fixture is
   included in the squash commit.

### 3.5 Cleanup

Remove ephemeral session files (they are untracked local state):

```bash
rm -f autoresearch.md autoresearch.sh autoresearch.jsonl
rm -rf experiments/
```

Delete the experiment branch:

```bash
git branch -d experiment/<goal>-<date>
```

### 3.6 Measure

Record measurement results on the work item via the runtime-provided work-item source before
closing. See the measure action for the full pattern. Record timestamp, status,
metric-improvement criterion pass/fail with evidence (baseline, final, delta),
ratchet values, and experiment iterations/confidence.

### 3.7 Close Work Item

Close the work item via the runtime-provided work-item source with a comprehensive close comment
recording execution evidence:

- Goal and optimization target
- Baseline metric value
- Final best metric value and delta
- Total iterations run and kept count
- Confidence score
- Key insights from the experiment
- Ratchet floor updates (if any)
- Files modified in the final squash commit

This is execution evidence on the issue, not a canonical HELIX doc.

### 3.8 Follow-On Issues

If the experiment revealed additional optimization opportunities, code quality
concerns, or architectural concerns:

- Create follow-on work items immediately.
- Make them atomic and deterministic.
- Set `spec-id` to the nearest governing artifact.
- Add the correct HELIX labels.

Do not silently absorb discovered work into the current experiment scope.

### 3.9 Report

Report trailer lines and a summary of the experiment session.

## Trailer Lines

Every invocation must end with these trailer lines:

```
EXPERIMENT_STATUS: CONVERGED|ITERATION_COMPLETE|NO_IMPROVEMENT|CLOSED
EXPERIMENT_ITERATIONS: N
EXPERIMENT_KEPT: N
EXPERIMENT_BEST: <metric>=<value> (<delta>% vs baseline)
EXPERIMENT_CONFIDENCE: <score>
MEASURE_STATUS: PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL
ITEM_ID: <id>
```

### Status Definitions

- `ITERATION_COMPLETE` — normal single-iteration exit. The skill or operator
  decides whether to continue. This is the expected status for most
  invocations.
- `CONVERGED` — confidence >= 2.0 for 3 consecutive keeps with < 1% delta
  between them. The metric has stabilized at an improved level. Further
  iteration is unlikely to yield significant gains.
- `NO_IMPROVEMENT` — no improvement in the last 5 consecutive iterations.
  The experiment has stalled. The operator should consider closing the session
  or changing strategy.
- `CLOSED` — session close completed (Step 3 executed). The experiment
  branch has been squash-merged (or skipped if zero improvement), the issue
  has been closed, and session files have been cleaned up.

These statuses are derived from the cumulative `autoresearch.jsonl` history,
not from within-invocation state. Each invocation reads the full log to
determine whether a convergence or stall pattern has emerged.

### Field Definitions

- `EXPERIMENT_ITERATIONS`: total number of iterations run across all
  invocations (read from `autoresearch.jsonl` run count).
- `EXPERIMENT_KEPT`: number of iterations whose changes were committed
  (status `kept` in JSONL).
- `EXPERIMENT_BEST`: the best metric value achieved and its percentage
  improvement over the baseline. Format: `<metric>=<value> (<delta>% vs
  baseline)`. If no improvement, report the baseline value with `0%`.
- `EXPERIMENT_CONFIDENCE`: the confidence score from Step 8, or
  `insufficient_data` if fewer than 3 results exist, or `N/A` on `CLOSED`
  status (confidence was already reported on the final iteration).

## Output Format

Report these sections in order:

1. Experiment Status (trailer lines)
2. Issue ID
3. Current Iteration Summary (hypothesis, result, keep/discard decision)
4. Cumulative Progress (iterations run, kept, best result, delta)
5. Confidence Assessment
6. Follow-On Issues Created (if any)
7. Suggested Next Step (continue iterating, close session, change strategy)

## Runtime Integration Appendix

This appendix covers how a runtime realizes the experiment action. The reference
paths and work-item acquisition below are runtime-neutral; for the concrete
commands of a specific runtime, see its install guide (DDx:
[docs/install/ddx.md](../../docs/install/ddx.md)).

### STEP 0 — Reference resolution

- Principles: `workflows/references/principles-resolution.md`
- Concerns: `workflows/references/concern-resolution.md`
- Ratchets: `workflows/ratchets.md`
- Metric-definition template: `workflows/activities/06-iterate/artifacts/metric-definition/template.yaml`
- Autoresearch-session template: `workflows/activities/06-iterate/artifacts/autoresearch-session/template.md`
- Autoresearch-worklog template: `workflows/activities/06-iterate/artifacts/autoresearch-worklog/template.md`

### STEP 1.2 — Claim

Claim the governing work item to prevent concurrent work. The runtime supplies
the work-item store; for the concrete commands see its install guide
([docs/install/ddx.md](../../docs/install/ddx.md) for DDx).

### STEP 3.6 — Measure

Record the results on the governing work item (in its notes, if the runtime
provides a notes field) as a `<measure-results>` block of this shape:

```
<measure-results>
  <timestamp>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ</timestamp>
  <status>PASS|FAIL</status>
  <metric-improvement baseline='<N>' final='<N>' delta='<N>%'/>
  <iterations total='N' kept='N'/>
  <confidence><score></confidence>
</measure-results>
```

### STEP 3.7 — Close

Close the governing work item with a summary comment ("Experiment closed.
<summary>").

### Action input examples

```
helix experiment
helix experiment <id>
helix experiment optimize test-suite-runtime
helix experiment --close <id>
```

### Output trailer

```
EXPERIMENT_STATUS: CONVERGED|ITERATION_COMPLETE|NO_IMPROVEMENT|CLOSED
EXPERIMENT_ITERATIONS: N
EXPERIMENT_KEPT: N
EXPERIMENT_BEST: <metric>=<value> (<delta>% vs baseline)
EXPERIMENT_CONFIDENCE: <score>
MEASURE_STATUS: PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL
ITEM_ID: <governing-item-id>
```

Be precise, quantitative, and operational.
