# US-XXX: [Story Title]

**Feature**: [FEAT-XXX — Feature Name]
**Feature Requirements**: [REQ-01, REQ-02]
**PRD Requirements**: [FR-n — the PRD functional requirement(s) this story covers]
**Priority**: [P0 | P1 | P2]
**Status**: [Draft | Review | Approved]

## Story

**As a** [specific user type from PRD personas]
**I want** [specific functionality — what the user does, not what the system does]
**So that** [measurable business value or user outcome]

## Context

[Why this story matters. What's the user's situation before this works? What
problem are they hitting? Which parent feature requirements does this story
exercise? This should be 2-4 sentences that give an implementer enough
background to make judgment calls without asking.]

## Walkthrough

[Step-by-step description of the user's journey through this slice. Write in
present tense. Name concrete actions and system responses. This is the
vertical slice — it should cover one complete path from trigger to outcome.]

1. User [action]
2. System [response]
3. User [action]
4. System [response — the outcome]

## Acceptance Criteria

[See the prompt's Acceptance Criteria guidance for the canonical AC-ID rule.]

- [ ] **US-XXX-AC1** — Given [specific precondition], when [specific action], then [observable outcome]
- [ ] **US-XXX-AC2** — Given [specific precondition], when [specific action], then [observable outcome]

## Edge Cases

[What happens when things go wrong or inputs are unexpected? Each edge case
should name the condition and the expected system behavior.]

- **[Condition]**: [Expected behavior]
- **[Condition]**: [Expected behavior]

## Test Scenarios

[Concrete input/output pairs for the acceptance criteria. An implementer
should be able to copy these into a test file.]

| Scenario | AC ID | Input / State | Action | Expected Result |
|----------|-------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Happy path | US-XXX-AC1 | [specific state] | [specific action] | [specific result] |
| [Edge case] | US-XXX-AC2 | [specific state] | [specific action] | [specific result] |

## Dependencies

- **Stories**: [US-XXX if this story depends on another being done first]
- **Feature Spec**: [FEAT-XXX]
- **Feature Requirements**: [REQ-01, REQ-02]
- **PRD Requirements**: [FR-n — PRD functional requirement(s) this story covers]
- **External**: [APIs, services, or data this story requires]

## Out of Scope

[What this story explicitly does not cover, to prevent scope creep during
implementation.]

## Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing a user story:

- [ ] Stored as its own file `US-NNN-<slug>.md` (one file per story — never a single monolithic `user-stories.md`)
- [ ] Covers one persona completing one goal, demonstrable end-to-end in a single flow
- [ ] Links to its parent `FEAT-NNN` and names the PRD `FR-n` it covers
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion is independently testable and carries a stable `US-NNN-ACm` ID
- [ ] Walkthrough traces a complete path from trigger to outcome; at least one edge case documented
