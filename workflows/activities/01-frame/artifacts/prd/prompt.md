# PRD Generation Prompt

Create a PRD that frames the problem, product scope, priorities, and success
criteria clearly enough that downstream feature specs, designs, tests, and
implementation work can trace back to it.

## Variant Selection (`kind`)

The PRD has two framing variants selected by the `kind` field in `meta.yml`:

- **`kind: product`** (default) — frames general product requirements.
- **`kind: data`** — frames a data product (pipeline, warehouse, data
  platform, or data service) with data sources, consumers, quality
  contracts, and platform context.

The shape of the artifact is unified; sections marked **(kind: data)** below
swap in the data-product framing when `kind: data`. Per ADR-008, both
framings share one role and one template — pick the variant that matches the
authored artifact and follow its conditional guidance.

## Storage Location

Store at: `docs/helix/01-frame/prd.md` (for either variant).

## Purpose

The PRD is the **product-scope authority for what to build and why**. Its
unique job is to translate the Product Vision into prioritized, measurable
requirements and boundaries. It sits between the product vision (which defines
direction) and feature specs (which define feature-level detail). Every design
decision and implementation choice should trace back to a PRD requirement.

**(kind: data)** When `kind: data`, the PRD is the **data-product-scope
authority for what data to build and why**. Its job is to translate business
intent into data-centric requirements: data sources, consumer personas,
quality contracts, technical constraints (catalog, schema, medallion layer),
and measurable success metrics. It sits between the Product Vision and the
data-architecture artifact. Every data pipeline design choice and quality
expectation should trace back to a Data PRD requirement.

## Reference Anchors

Use these local resource summaries as grounding:

- `docs/resources/atlassian-prd.md` frames a PRD as shared understanding of purpose, behavior, user needs, assumptions, out-of-scope items, and success criteria.
- `docs/resources/aha-prd-template.md` supports concise cross-functional scope: what is being built, who it is for, and how it delivers value.
- `docs/resources/ibm-requirements-management.md` grounds measurable, prioritized, traceable requirements and validation/verification discipline.

**(kind: data)** When `kind: data`, also use:

- `docs/resources/databricks-unity-catalog.md` grounds data governance through unified catalog hierarchies (metastore → catalog → schema → volume/table).
- `docs/resources/databricks-lakehouse-medallion-architecture.md` grounds medallion topology (Bronze/Silver/Gold) and layer responsibilities in a Lakehouse.
- `docs/resources/databricks-sdp.md` grounds Databricks Semantic Data Platform governance, lineage, and quality contracts through `EXPECT ... ON VIOLATION ...` clauses and SDP-aware pipeline patterns.

If you adopt this on another data platform, substitute Databricks concepts
with the platform equivalent (Snowflake DB/Schema/Table; BigQuery
Project/Dataset/Table; Snowpipe/Streaming Inserts for Auto Loader;
dbt/Great Expectations for SDP `EXPECT` clauses). The medallion pattern
applies universally.

## Key Principles

- **Problem first** — the problem section should make someone feel the pain
  before they see the solution.
- **Decision-oriented** — every section should help someone make a build/skip
  decision. If a section doesn't inform a decision, it's filler.
- **Testable requirements** — every P0 requirement should be verifiable. If
  you can't describe how to test it, it's too vague.
- **Traceable boundaries** — requirements should connect upward to the Product
  Vision and downward to feature specs, designs, tests, and build work.
- **Honest non-goals** — non-goals should exclude things someone might
  reasonably expect to be in scope. "Not a replacement for X" only matters if
  someone might assume it is.

## Section-by-Section Guidance

### Summary
Write this last. This section must work as a **standalone 1-pager**: what
we're building, who uses it, the problem, the solution approach, and the top
2-3 success metrics. Someone who reads only this section should understand the
product well enough to decide whether to invest time in the full PRD. Test:
could a new team member read this alone and explain the product to someone
else?

### Problem
Describe the failure mode, not the absence of your solution. "Users don't have
a X" is weak. "Users spend N hours/week doing Y manually because Z doesn't
exist, leading to W failures" is strong. Quantify where possible.

### Goals
Each goal should describe a state change, not an activity. "Build a dashboard"
is an activity. "Operators can see system health without SSH" is a state
change.

### Success Metrics
Every metric needs three things: what you're measuring, a numeric target, and
how you'll measure it. "User satisfaction" is not a metric. "NPS > 40 from
monthly survey of active users" is. Drop the Timeline column — success metrics
should define what success looks like, not when it happens.

**(kind: data)** When `kind: data`, frame metrics for the data product
itself: throughput (rows/day), latency (max age end-to-end), quality score
(percentage of expectations passing), cost per GB or per DBU, freshness-SLA
compliance, and consumer satisfaction. Each metric still needs a numeric
target and a named measurement method — e.g., "SLA compliance > 95% measured
by on-time delivery vs. promised refresh cadence."

### Non-Goals
Each non-goal should prevent scope creep on something plausible. "Not a
general-purpose AI" is only useful if someone might think it is. Test: would
someone on the team argue for including this? If not, it's not a useful
non-goal.

### Personas
Name them. Give them a role, goals, and pain points specific enough to
validate with a real person. "Alex the Developer" with generic goals is a
template, not a persona.

**(kind: data)** When `kind: data`, frame this section as **Data Consumers**
instead of personas. Name actual teams, systems, or roles that consume the
data, their use case (what decisions they make), their freshness/latency SLA,
the key dimensions they query, and their access level (row, column, full).
Add an inventory of upstream **Data Sources** in a parallel section: source
system, schema/table, owner, update frequency, quality baseline, and notes
on API limits or retry policy. Generic personas are insufficient for a data
product — the consumer and source tables drive every downstream design and
quality decision.

### Requirements (P0/P1/P2)
P0 = the product is broken without this. P1 = the product is weak without
this. P2 = the product is better with this. If you have more than 7 P0s,
you're not prioritizing.

Each requirement should be stable enough to trace into feature specs and tests.
If a requirement describes a screen, algorithm, API field, or implementation
sequence in detail, move that detail downstream and keep the PRD at product
scope.

### Functional Requirements
These are the detailed behavioral specs. Each one should be testable — someone
reading it should know how to write an acceptance test.

**(kind: data)** When `kind: data`, the functional requirements describe
**data behavior**: ingestion cadence, deduplication rules, transformation
contracts, freshness windows, schema-evolution policy, and consumer-facing
table or feed definitions. Add a **Data Quality Requirements** subsection
with quality dimensions (completeness, timeliness, accuracy, uniqueness)
each carrying a P0 threshold, a P1 threshold, a measurement method, and an
enforcement strategy (alert, reject, quarantine). Reference the
`data-quality-expectations` artifact for executable `EXPECT` clauses per
medallion layer; the PRD owns the requirement, the expectations artifact
owns the contract.

**Group requirements under named subsystems.** Organize FRs by subsystem (not by
priority) under canonical, parseable headings: `### Subsystem: <name>`. Each
`FR-n` belongs to **exactly one** subsystem. A subsystem is a cohesive capability
of the product — the unit that becomes a feature: **one subsystem maps to ~one
feature spec** (`FEAT-NNN`). This is the PRD↔FEAT boundary — the PRD owns
*breadth* (it names every subsystem and enumerates all `FR-n` + priorities); the
feature spec owns *depth* (one subsystem's behavior, ACs, edge cases). A
multi-subsystem product must not collapse into a single mega-feature, nor should
one subsystem fragment into many tiny features. (The feature spec's Decomposition
test resolves borderline cases; reconcile-alignment checks that every subsystem
maps to a feature.)

Give each functional requirement a **stable `FR-n` ID** (`FR-1`, `FR-2`, …). The
ID is the trace anchor: every `FR-n` must be covered by ≥1 user story, and
reconcile-alignment flags any `FR-n` with no story as a coverage gap. Number
sequentially and never renumber on edit — downstream stories reference the ID by
name.

### Acceptance Test Sketches
For each P0 requirement, write a concrete scenario: what the user does, what
input they provide, and what observable result they see. These aren't full test
cases — they're the minimum an implementer (human or agent) needs to verify
the requirement is met. An AI agent should be able to read a sketch and write
a passing test without asking clarifying questions.

### Technical Context
Name the stack, key dependencies with versions, API schemas, and platform
targets. Be specific enough that an implementer knows what to install and what
interfaces to code against. "React" is not enough — "React 18 with TypeScript
5.x and Vite 6" is. If there's an API schema (OpenAPI, GraphQL SDL), point to
it. This section exists because AI agents need concrete dependency and
interface information to produce correct implementations.

**Important**: This section records stack decisions — it does not make them.
Stack selection rationale belongs in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records). If
you're documenting a choice that doesn't have an ADR yet, note it in Open
Questions. If an existing ADR contradicts what you'd write here, the ADR
governs until it's superseded.

**(kind: data)** When `kind: data`, frame the technical context as the
**data-platform context**: target catalog and schema (e.g., `prod.customer_360`),
medallion layer strategy (Bronze/Silver/Gold scopes and responsibilities),
ingestion pattern (Auto Loader, Streaming Tables, batch), processing model
(streaming vs batch vs incremental), compute tier (all-purpose, jobs,
serverless), storage format (Delta, Parquet), DBU budget assumption, and
governance posture (data classification, retention policy, audit trail,
lineage). Pin the access-control model: row-level security, column masking,
and the catalog policies that enforce it. Same ADR discipline applies — the
PRD records platform decisions, ADRs justify them.

### Constraints
Name real constraints, not aspirational ones. "Must work on mobile" is a
constraint only if you'd otherwise skip it. Budget, compliance, and platform
constraints matter most.

### Assumptions
These are bets. When an assumption is wrong, the plan breaks. Name each one
so the team knows what to watch.

### Risks
Each risk needs a concrete mitigation, not "monitor closely." If the
mitigation is monitoring, say what you'll monitor and what triggers action.

### Open Questions
List unresolved items explicitly rather than leaving `[TBD]` markers
scattered through the document. Each question should name who can answer it
and what's blocked by it. This section is honest about what you don't know
yet — it's better to have a clear list of unknowns than a document that
pretends to be complete.

### Success Criteria
These are the acceptance criteria for the entire initiative. They should be
observable outcomes ("operators can do X without Y") not activities ("we
shipped Z").
