# Build Plan

## Scope

**Governing Artifacts**:
- [docs/helix/01-frame/...]
- [docs/helix/02-design/...]
- [docs/helix/03-test/...]

## Shared Constraints

- [Constraint from requirements, design, architecture, or security]

## Implementation Slices

| Slice | Story / Area | Governing Artifacts | Depends On | Validation Gate | Notes |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| [B-001] | [US-XXX or area] | [TP/TD refs] | None | [Command/evidence] | [Why first] |
| [B-002] | [US-XXX or area] | [TP/TD refs] | [Dependency] | [Command/evidence] | [Why next] |

## Issue Decomposition

Story-level work is tracked as work items in the runtime's work-item store.

**Per-issue requirements**:
- Labels: `helix`, `activity:build`, `kind:build`, `story:US-{story-id}`
- References: user story, technical design, story test plan, this build plan
- `spec-id` pointing at the nearest governing artifact
- Blockers as dependency links

| Story / Area | Goal | Dependencies |
|--------------|------|--------------|
| [US-XXX] | [Outcome] | [Deps] |

## Validation Plan

- [ ] Failing tests exist before implementation starts
- [ ] All required tests pass before closing a build issue
- [ ] Behavior changes update canonical documents
- [ ] Code review is complete before activity exit

## Risks and Rollbacks

| Risk | Impact | Response | Rollback |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| [Risk] | [H/M/L] | [Action] | [How to reverse or disable] |

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Build issue set is defined with sequence and dependencies
- [ ] Shared constraints are documented
- [ ] Verification expectations are explicit
- [ ] Runtime issues can be created from this plan without inventing scope

## Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing an implementation plan:

- [ ] Governing artifacts are listed and exist on disk
- [ ] Shared constraints trace back to requirements, design, or architecture
- [ ] Build sequence has a justified ordering — not just arbitrary
- [ ] Dependencies between build steps are explicit
- [ ] Each story/area references its governing artifacts (TP, TD)
- [ ] Issue decomposition follows tracker conventions (labels, spec-id, deps)
- [ ] Quality gates are specific and enforceable, not aspirational
- [ ] Risks have concrete responses ("we do X"), not vague strategies
- [ ] Plan is consistent with governing test plan and technical designs
