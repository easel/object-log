## Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing an ADR:

- [ ] Context names a specific problem — not "we need to decide about X"
- [ ] Decision statement is actionable — "we will" not "we should consider"
- [ ] At least two alternatives were evaluated
- [ ] Each alternative has concrete pros and cons, not vague assessments
- [ ] Selected option's rationale explains why it wins over the best alternative
- [ ] Consequences include both positive and negative impacts
- [ ] Negative consequences have documented mitigations
- [ ] Risks are specific with probability and impact assessments
- [ ] Validation section defines how we'll know if the decision was right
- [ ] Review triggers define conditions for reconsidering the decision
- [ ] Concern impact section is complete (or explicitly marked as no impact)
- [ ] ADR is consistent with governing feature spec and PRD requirements
